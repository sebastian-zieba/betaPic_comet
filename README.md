# A transiting exocomet detected in broadband light by TESS in the $\beta$ Pictoris system

This repository containts various files, which were used for the paper Zieba et al. (2019) (link).

This repository containts the following repositories:

- betaPic_movies:

Contains four short (each ~1min and ~10MB) movies of beta Pictoris created by cutting out a 60x60 pixel area around the star using a jupyter notebook (which also can be found there). The mid-exposure time is marked just above the animation in BTJD (BJD - 2457000). Every movie shows the observations of beta Pic for a specific sector. No background objects (asteroids, ...) are visible before, during or after the dimming events.
